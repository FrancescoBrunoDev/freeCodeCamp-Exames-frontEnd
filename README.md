This project is the exam for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Course. The aim of the project was to build 5 web applications using Next.js with Tailwind CSS. The web applications are:

1. Random Quote Machine
2. Markdown Previewer
3. Drum Machine
4. JavaScript Calculator
5. 25 + 5 Clock

All 5 projects have been completed within the timeframe of 25th April to 4th May 2023.

## Random Quote Machine

The Random Quote Machine is a web application that displays a random quote each time the user clicks on the "New Quote" button. The user can also tweet the displayed quote by clicking on the "Tweet" button.

## Markdown Previewer

The Markdown Previewer is a web application that converts Markdown text into HTML code in real-time. The user can input Markdown text into the editor and the preview panel will display the rendered HTML output.

## Drum Machine

The Drum Machine is a web application that simulates a drum kit. The user can play the drum kit by clicking on the buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## JavaScript Calculator

The JavaScript Calculator is a web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user can input numbers and use the calculator buttons to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 25 + 5 Clock

The 25 + 5 Clock is a web application that functions as a countdown timer. The user can set the work time and break time intervals and the timer will switch between the two intervals.

All of the above web applications have been built using Next.js with Tailwind CSS. The project has been uploaded to GitHub and is available for viewing and download.
